# freetube

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Here I'm trying to build a youtube clone using the free video api provided by youTube itself.

## overView

-> There is a splash landing screen after that you will redirected to home screen in which you can 
    see multiple trending videos on youtube.

## Functionality integrated

-> In this app. you can watch trending videos from home screen.
-> There is a search functionality in this clone application by which you can search what ever you
    want.
-> Many more functionality will be added in future.(WIP...!)
